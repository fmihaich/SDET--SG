## About this repository

This repository contains the solution for **``Deviget``** exercise for **``SDET``** position.

**Exercise description**: *As a Customer we want to see if the second Iphone related ad from the second results page 
from www.aliexpress.com has at least 1 item to be bought.*


The ``test case`` related to the exercise description is defined in the following feature file:

* [Feature: Product availability](tests/ui/aliexpress/features/product_availability.feature)

Actually, there are 2 scenarios defined in that feature file:

* Scenario: Check second product of second result page availability
    * It follows exactly the exercise requirement.
    * It is tagged as ``@EXERCISE``

* Scenario: Check third product of first result page availability with gallery view
    * It really similar to the exercise description. It tests other item view and shows the re-usability of steps.
    * It is tagged as ``@EXTRA``

Each test case can be executed using **``Chrome``** or **``Firefox``** browsers.


## Technical decisions

The framework selected for the implementation of the test cases is [**Behave**](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

`Behave` is behaviour-driven development, `Python` style. It is based on tests written in a natural language style, 
backed up by Python code.

Behavior-driven development (or `BDD`) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration 
between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

The language used to describe the different application functionalities is `Gherkin`. It handles two purposes: 
serving as your project's documentation and automated tests.

For automate real user interactions with browsers, it is chosen `Selenium Webdriver` framework (see 
[selenium-python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) documentation)

Regarding the design pattern, AliExpress web pages are modeled using `Page objects`. Each class defined in 
[page_objects](tests/ui/aliexpress/page_objects/) acts as interfaces for page interaction.

For test report generation [cucumber-html-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cucumber-html-reporter) is used.

Testing environment is [**dockerized**](https://www.docker.com/) making it easier to be integrated in any CI/CD 
pipeline, and also to run in different OS host machines.


## Testing environment

It is only necessary to have `docker` installed and running in the host machine to execute the test suit 
(with chrome or firefox browser).

The test environment is a `docker-compose` environment defined in [ui_tests.yml](ui_tests.yml).

It has 3 main components:

* A `selenium/standalone-chrome` service (based on a specific docker image),
* A `selenium/standalone-firefox` service (based on a specific docker image), and
* A `test_runner` service, that is built based on [test_runner/Dockerfile](test_runner/Dockerfile) definition.

The test runner is basically a `python` docker container which has also installed `npm` for generating 
test suit `html` reports.


### How to run tests

You can simply run **``./script/ui_test``** (source: [script/ui_test](script/ui_test)) ðŸ˜„ 

Besides, to run test suit with chrome and firefox browser (sequentially), you can run 
**``./script/ui_test_all_browsers``** (source: [script/ui_test_all_browsers](script/ui_test_all_browsers))

If you manually want to run or edit UI tests, start the [ui_tests.yml](ui_tests.yml) docker-compose 
environment by running:

```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml up &
```

To check running services in the docker-compose environment then execute:
```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml ps
```

To run all defined UI tests, execute:

```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml exec test_runner tests/ui/run
```

The default browser is ``chrome``, but you can also run test using firefox by setting ``BROWSER=firefox`` 
environment variable:

```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml exec -e BROWSER=firefox test_runner tests/ui/run
```

If you want to edit or add new UI tests, then run the following command and work on your any editor locally:
```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml exec test_runner /bin/bash
```

To see what is happening in the browser while running tests, it is possible to use `VNC Viewer` and configure 
`chrome` or `firefox` connections (`localhost:9000` or `localhost:9001` respectively, 
according to current yml definition).

After everything is done, down the docker-compose environment:

```bash
docker-compose -f ui_tests.yml down -v
```

## Test execution output

Test execution output is store in ``tests/ui/output/<browser>/``, where browser can be chrome or firefox.

The output directory includes:
* One folder per each executed scenario that stores one browser image per executed step.
* Result in `json` format (if execution was run through [tests/ui/run](tests/ui/run) script 
or specifying a json formatter)
* The **`result.html`** with the summary of the test execution (if execution was run through 
[tests/ui/run](tests/ui/run))


## Test report samples

There are 2 report samples in [test_results_samples](test_results_samples) repo folder.

These reports corresponds to the suit execution, one running using `chrome` browser and the other using 
`firefox` browser. 

The following image shows one execution summary:

## Found issues

During the development of this exercise, the following ``random`` issues were found:

* Change search result view does not always work:
    * Sometimes a click on `gallery` view continues showing search results as list.
    * A workaround that frequently works is to reload the page.
* Click on search result page 2 (or any other different page than the current one) not always refresh the shown 
products:
    * A workaround that frequently works is to reload the page.

``Note``: This issues were not reproduced the 100% of the times. 
For that reason it was possible to get ``green reports`` for test execution, but it is also possible to see 
an scenario failing randomly.
